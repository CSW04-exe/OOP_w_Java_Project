This is a Java-based matrix calculator that supports core linear algebra operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, inverse, and eigen decomposition. The project was built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to keep the logic, user interface, and control flow cleanly separated. The graphical user interface was developed using Java Swing, providing an interactive experience for users working with matrices. All matrix operations are implemented from scratch without external libraries, making this a useful project for reinforcing both linear algebra concepts and object-oriented design principles in Java.
